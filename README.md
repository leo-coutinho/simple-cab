## Technical Overview



### MySQL

 - Schema name simple-cab.
 - Connection name : jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/simple-cab?useSSL=false

 - Tables settings use default settings
 - The other columns will be generated by changing the application.properties file to
   spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=create after the first application run change
   this spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update otherwise the tables will be created again
   and you will loose all previously entered data.
   Bellow are the Schema.tableNames used by this application:

   - `simple-cab`.cab_trip_data'
